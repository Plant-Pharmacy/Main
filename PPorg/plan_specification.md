# Plan Specification

## Coordination

- Weekly goals 
    - Meet in person or discord on Friday/Saturday morning 
- Agenda 
    - Project Manager is the note taker, but Everyone can contribute 
    - Check-in with everyone their progress, testing, remaining roadblocks
    - Assign who helps with roadblocks post-meeting
    - Define next week’s goals/phases and deadlines 
    - Define each member's schedule for working on their part of the project within the week.

## Communication

- Discord channels
    - General
    - Tutorials/Resources (for both front-end and back-end)
    - General documents - easy access to general meetings notes, Google documents, and Github links
- Use Github Projects to communicate progress.
- Alternatives
    - Alternative lines of communication include email, text message, and Facebook messenger, but only in the case of nonresponsiveness to Discord Channel.
